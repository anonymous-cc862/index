您提的非常对，感谢您的指正。我的上一条总结不够精确。

您观察得非常敏锐。对话中确实提到他们目前已经有了一个日内更新的机制，但那个机制是一个极其简单的、非模型的规则。

我们来回顾一下对话中的关键信息（23:57）：

Speaker 2: "I what we do currently a it's a very, super simple, right? We never tried to model this. What we do currently is we in the morning we predicted a town is going to be stable. We look how much they have. Now. Let's say they have now 700 k we take the minimum of these two. So there is no modeling super simple logic right now."

这段话直译过来就是：

“我们现在的做法非常非常简单，对吧？**我们从未尝试去建模。**我们现在的做法是：我们早上预测了一个稳定库存，然后看他们现在还剩多少。比如现在还剩70万，我们就取（昨日预测的稳定库存和当前剩余库存）这两个数的最小值。所以现在只有一个超级简单的逻辑，没有模型。”

因此，更精确的描述新员工的第一个任务应该是：

用一个真正的、基于数据和概率的“预测模型”，来取代并升级现有的那个极其简陋的、基于“取最小值”规则的日内更新逻辑。

我们可以这样对比：

现有方法 (Current Method): 规则驱动。

逻辑是：更新后的稳定库存 = Min(昨日预测的稳定库存, 当前实际剩余库存)。

这只是一个简单的逻辑判断，没有智能或预测的成分。如领导所说，这“不是模型 (no modeling)”。

新项目 (New Project): 模型驱动。

逻辑是：更新后的稳定库存 = f(昨日稳定性, 今日交易行为, ...)。

这是一个需要真正去建模的任务，需要利用新的信息（如当日交易量）来重新预测一个更准确的稳定库存概率分布，而不仅仅是做一次大小比较。

所以，您的理解是完全正确的。核心任务不是从“静态”到“动态”的创建，而是将日内更新的“逻辑”提升为“模型”，实现从简单规则到智能预测的跨越。





好的，这段长对话信息量非常丰富，它详细介绍了一个金融机构（可能是投行或券商）内部，特别是其 Delta One 交易台 和 中央库存管理 (CIM) 团队 的核心业务逻辑。对话由一位资深人士（说话人2）向一位新员工（说话人3）介绍其即将开展的项目背景。

核心业务围绕着中国A股市场的特殊交易规则展开，主要解决了两大问题：

如何帮助客户在无法直接做空的市场中实现多空策略？

如何管理因出借股票给做空客户而产生的库存和召回风险？

以下是对话中提到的核心概念和运行逻辑的中文详细解释：

核心概念与业务逻辑分解
1. Delta One 业务与中国市场的“合成做空” (Box Trade)
这部分内容与您上一个问题中的对话完全一致，是整个业务的起点。

背景问题 (The Problem): 中国市场禁止裸卖空，必须持有实体股票（现货）才能卖出。这给希望执行多空策略的量化对冲基金（如文艺复兴/Renaissance）带来了障碍。

解决方案 (The Solution): "盒子交易" (Box Trade)，即通过**总收益互换(TRS)或差价合约(CFD)**来合成一个空头头寸。

运行逻辑 (Operational Logic):

建仓 (Build the Box):

客户（基金）提供一个股票组合。

投行（Delta One 交易台）买入所有这些实体股票。

客户获得这些股票的所有权，同时与投行签订一份做空等值股票组合的CFD合约。

结果： 客户持有“多头现货 + 空头衍生品”，净风险敞口为零。

交易 (Execution):

想做空： 卖出持有的实体股票。例如，卖掉20万股现货，净头寸就变成-20万股（因为空头衍生品合约不变）。

想做多： 买入更多的实体股票。例如，再买入20万股现货，净头寸就变成+20万股。

投行的风险 (The Bank's Risk): 投行作为客户的交易对手，持有了CFD的多头头寸。这个巨大的多头风险敞口（对话中称为 "Delta one book that we are hedging"）必须被对冲掉。对冲风险是Delta One交易台的一项核心工作，通常会使用Barra等多因子模型 (Factor Models) 来构建对冲组合（如卖出股指期货等），以最小化风险敞口（Portfolio - Hedge的风险）。

2. 中央库存管理系统 (CIM - China Inventory) 与 借券业务
这是对话后半段引入的另一个核心业务，与前述业务紧密相关但模式不同。它更像一个内部的“股票池”或“借贷平台”。

参与方 (The Players):

生产者 (Producers): 持有大量股票多头的客户（如做市商、各类基金）。他们是库存的提供方。

消费者 (Consumers): 希望做空股票的客户。他们是库存的使用方。

平台 (The Platform): 投行的中央库存管理系统 (CIM)，负责汇集“生产者”的库存，并将其出借给“消费者”。

运行逻辑 (Operational Logic):

库存汇集: “生产者”客户持有的长期股票头寸被纳入CIM的中央库存池。

满足做空需求: 当“消费者”客户想要做空某只股票时，CIM会从库存池中“借出”相应的股票，在市场上卖掉，从而为“消费者”客户建立一个空头头寸。

3. “召回”风险 (Recall Risk)
这是CIM业务模式中最关键的风险点。

什么是召回 (What is a Recall): 股票的原始所有者（生产者）随时有权卖出自己的股票。如果“生产者”决定卖出1000股，而这1000股中已有200股被借给“消费者”做空了，那么CIM就必须从“消费者”那里强制收回这200股的空头头寸，以还给“生产者”。这个强制平仓的动作就叫“召回”。

为什么召回是坏事 (Why Recall is Bad): 对于“消费者”来说，召回是极不受欢迎的。他们可能刚刚建立空头头寸，并预期股价会下跌，但第二天就被强制平仓（召回），这使得他们的交易策略无法实现，无法获利。

受保护客户 (Protected Clients): 对话提到，有些重要的客户有“免召回”协议。如果发生库存不足，投行的Delta One交易台会自己承担这个风险，即Delta One交易台会建立一个多头头寸（+200），来补上这个窟窿，而“受保护的”做空客户的空头头寸（-200）则不受影响。这构成了Delta One交易台的另一个风险来源。

4. “稳定性”建模 (Stability Modeling) - 新员工的核心项目
为了解决“召回”风险，团队需要对库存的**“稳定性”**进行建模。

业务目标 (Business Objective): 不能将“生产者”持有的全部库存（如100万股）都展示给“消费者”并提供借用，因为“生产者”随时可能卖出。团队需要预测这100万股中有多少是“稳定”的，即“生产者”在短期内（如第二天）不会卖出的部分。

如何运作 (How it Works):

建模预测: 模型会分析“生产者”的行为，预测其明天可能卖出的数量。比如模型预测某持有100万股的客户明天会卖出20万股。

计算稳定库存: 那么“稳定”的库存就是 100万 - 200万 = 80万股。

提供可用库存: 团队只会向“消费者”客户展示并提供这80万股的可用做空额度。这样做能大大降低发生“召回”的概率。

模型的本质: 这不是一个追求精确预测的“预测模型”，而是一个概率模型 (Probabilistic Model)。它输出的不是一个确切的数字，而是一个概率分布，描述了客户可能卖出不同数量股票的概率。基于这个分布，团队可以做出决策，例如取90%分位数的稳定性，以达到业务所需的风险水平。

5. 项目的具体任务：日内稳定性更新 (Intraday Stability Update)
这是分配给新员工的第一个项目，是现有稳定性模型的升级。

现有模型的局限: 当前的模型是在每天收盘后（End of Day）计算一次第二天的稳定性。但市场是动态的。

新项目的目标: 开发一个日内 (Intraday) 实时更新的稳定性模型。

场景: 假设昨天收盘后模型计算出某客户的100万股中有80万股是稳定的。今天上午11点，该客户已经卖出了10万股。

问题: 获得了“客户已卖出10万股”这个新信息 (Extra Information) 后，剩余的90万股中，现在有多少是稳定的？这个数字需要被实时更新。

初步思路: 新的模型将利用两个核心输入：

前一天的稳定性结果 (Previous day stability)。

当天截至目前的客户交易活动 (Client's trading activity up to this time)。

当前做法 (Super Simple Logic): 目前的临时做法非常简单粗暴，就是取“前日稳定数”和“当前剩余数”的最小值。新项目需要用更科学的模型来替代它，并通过回测证明其优越性。

实施建议: 资深人士建议新员工从简入手，不要过度复杂化。先用最核心的两个变量（前日稳定性和当日交易量）建立一个简单模型，验证其有效性后，再考虑加入更多特征（如成交量、其他股票层面的信息）来优化。

总结
这段对话清晰地描绘了现代投行量化团队的工作内容：

业务驱动： 所有的模型和项目都源于实际的业务需求和痛点（如交易限制、风险管理）。

模型核心： 通过复杂的金融工程（合成做空）和概率统计模型（稳定性预测）来解决这些问题。

风险管理： Delta One交易台是风险的最终承担者和对冲者，时刻需要管理因各项业务产生的风险敞口。

迭代优化： 模型和系统在不断迭代升级，从每日一次的批处理模型，到追求更精确、更实时的日内模型，以适应瞬息万变的市场。







好的，这段对话描述的是一种在中国A股市场（或其他有严格卖空限制的市场）执行**多空策略（Long-Short Strategy）**的常见方法。由于无法直接借券卖空，对冲基金等机构投资者会通过与投行（对话中提到的“我们”，即Delta One交易台）合作，利用金融衍生品来“合成”一个空头头寸。

这种操作在业内通常被称为**“收益互换” (Total Return Swap, TRS) 或基于差价合约 (CFD) 的合成做空策略**。对话中提到的 “Box Trade” (盒子交易) 是一个形象的说法，指代最初构建的那个“多头现货+空头衍生品”的零风险头寸。

内容解释
这段对话的核心内容是：一家想在中国市场做多空的对冲基金（以“文艺复兴”Renaissance为例），如何通过投行的Delta One交易台绕开卖空限制。

面临的问题： 中国市场不允许裸卖空，必须持有实体股票才能卖出。

解决方案： 基金与投行合作，构建一个包含“实体股票多头”和“衍生品空头”的组合，从而可以灵活地调整净头寸，实现做多或做空的目的。

运行逻辑 (Step-by-Step)
我们可以把整个过程分解为三个阶段：建仓、交易、以及投行的风险管理。

参与方：

客户 (Client)： 对冲基金“Renaissance”，想要执行多空策略。

中介/交易对手 (Counterparty)： 投行的“Delta One交易台”。

第一步：建立初始“零风险”头寸 (构建 "The Box")
客户提供组合： 基金向投行提供一个庞大的股票投资组合清单（比如4000只股票）和初始的头寸要求。

投行买入现货： 投行的Delta One交易台根据这个清单，在公开市场上买入所有这些实体股票。

建立“多头”与“空头”：

实体股票多头 (Long Physical Stocks)： 投行将买入的这些实体股票的所有权（在法律或名义上）转移给基金。现在，基金持有这4000只股票的多头现货。

衍生品空头 (Short CFD/Swap)： 同时，基金与投行签订一份差价合约 (CFD) 或总收益互换 (TRS)。合约内容是基金做空一个与上述实体股票组合完全相同的投资组合。

形成“零风险盒子”：

此时，基金的状态是：多头实体股票 + 空头衍生品合约。

这两个头寸的价值完全相等，方向完全相反。无论市场如何涨跌，实体股票的盈利（或亏损）都会被衍生品合约的亏损（或盈利）完全抵消。

因此，基金的净风险敞口为零。它被“锁在”一个没有风险的盒子里，等待下一步操作。

第二步：执行多空策略 (打开 "The Box" 进行交易)
基金的净头寸 = 持有的实体股票数量 - 衍生品合约上的空头数量。
关键点在于，衍生品合约是固定不变的，基金通过买卖实体股票来调整自己的净头寸。

如何做空 (Open a Short Position):

场景： 基金认为某只股票会下跌。

操作： 基金直接在市场上卖出它持有的该只实体股票。

举例：

初始状态：持有100万股A公司股票（多头），同时持有100万股A公司的CFD空头合约。净头寸 = 100万 - 100万 = 0。

基金卖出20万股实体股票。

现在状态：持有80万股A公司股票，但CFD空头合约依然是100万股。

最终净头寸 = 80万 - 100万 = -20万股。 基金成功地建立了20万股的空头头寸。

如何做多 (Open a Long Position):

场景： 基金认为某只股票会上涨。

操作： 基金在市场上买入更多的该只实体股票。

举例：

初始状态：净头寸为0。

基金买入20万股实体股票。

现在状态：持有120万股A公司股票，CFD空头合约依然是100万股。

最终净头寸 = 120万 - 100万 = +20万股。 基金成功地建立了20万股的多头头寸。

第三步：投行的角色和风险管理
投行的头寸： 在这个结构中，投行是基金的交易对手。当基金做空CFD合约时，投行就持有了相应的CFD多头合约。

投行的风险： 这意味着投行对整个庞大的股票组合拥有了巨大的多头风险敞口 (Long Exposure)。如果市场下跌，投行将面临亏损。

对冲 (Hedging)： 这个多头风险敞口就是对话中提到的 “Delta One book that we are hedging”。Delta One交易台的核心工作就是对冲掉这个风险敞口，通常通过股指期货或其他工具来操作，以确保自身的风险中性。

总结
这种结构是一种精巧的金融工程设计，其核心运行逻辑是：通过场外衍生品（CFD/TRS）在合约层面建立一个固定的“空头”，然后通过在场内市场买卖“现货”来动态调整最终的净风险敞口，从而在禁止直接卖空的市场中，变相地实现了多空自由交易的目的。 这对基金来说是高效的策略执行工具，对投行来说则是重要的机构客户业务，但需要强大的资本实力和风险对冲能力。


20250708_101206
说话人1 00:12
So I think for those rolling, maybe anyway, first of all, nasa in 2 months or 1 months, 2 months ago. And I want to trades me personality. So I was asking if you have been introduced to people.
说话人2 01:19
absolutely to get access to the right. So you do that and that once you do it, because we need to ask sk for approval, ii would think is secretary ok I don't know how much have the guys give you background, what we do.
说话人3 01:36
I learned some like the business in our team from treating and she and oliver. And like, firstly, one we want to our main task is to do the short and long block brokerage from our client, like do some prediction for the stability? Okay?
说话人2 02:04
We don't call it prediction, we call it modeling.
说话人3 02:07
important.
说话人2 02:09
It's a big difference once you start talking to business.

Okay?
说话人3 02:13
The other portion is the like delta one business, like we want to force forced along some stock.

And then maybe I think we can do some like alpha of our investment based on this to like this position and stocks.
说话人2 02:50
So the just I will start from the scratch, right? Some of them we have covered when we're interviewing you, but whatever, right? So the main focus is on china. So basically, everything I say you can think of.
说话人1 03:09
in china from china perspective.
说话人2 03:11
Right? So there are from delta one trading perspective.
说话人1 03:18
Right? So can I.
说话人2 03:22
the because in china, you cannot short. Yeah, that's right. So you have to have physical stock in order to sell it. Now, let's say some company, right? I don't know. Did you see our client list already or you didn't have chance? Let's say some company wants to do this long, short strategies, right? What is non stop? I know. So the way they can do it, it's called box trade. What they do is they come to us.

Now, let's say this is raining, right? The renaissance. Yeah. They come to us and they say we want this portfolio, which is like 4,000 stocks. Right? And then they give us the delta's how much they want. And they want to buy and sell this this part from this portfolio. Right now, what we do is this is raining right now. This is the taiwan desk. We buy all these talks. We go to the market and buy them, right? And then we give it to running. Yeah. Are you familiar with this? As I wanna explain to.
说话人3 04:36
you? I think i'm familiar because we want to reduce the recall. So we have.
说话人2 04:44
forget about recall. This is not about recordings from delta one perspective, because delta one has a portfolio that needs to hedge. I'm basically explaining where this portfolio comes.
说话人3 04:56
Okay?
说话人2 04:57
Then we buy these talks, we give it to running.

Now, running has all these physical stocks, right? And then they do a contract with us, cfd contract, exactly the same portfolio. So they are long stocks, short, this contract. So they have zero risk, right? Let's say, stock one. They are, let's say, 1 million stock and 1 million short cfd with with us for the whole portfolio. They have zero literally zero risk they want.

Now, if they want to, let's say, they think this stock is going down. They have the physical, so they will sell, let's say they say, to sell 200 k now they have 800 k stock and - 1 million cfd so they don't touch the short part. This is contract with us. The total on this stock is - 200 k that's how they open short position. If they think the stock is going up, they buy. If they buy, let's say they buy K so they are 1 . 2 million long, 1 million short. So they are not long, 200 k this is how they do the long, short strategies.

Now, the thing is that when we do this contract, if rain is short, this contract, right? So they are long stocks, short the contract with us, then we end up having long this, what we do. Basically, we end up having long exposure to this portfolio. This is what this is one of the things that we had. So we need to have this.
说话人3 06:53
Okay?
说话人2 06:54
The delta one book that we are hedging. It's either this or the,
说话人3 07:08
sorry.
说话人2 07:10
Then the cim are you familiar with cim.
说话人3 08:05
no.
说话人2 08:06
So the siam is basically it's a china inventory. So you have all these clients that have long positions, long stocks, right? And then this goes into the central inventory. Then we have consumer clients.
说话人3 08:23
Okay?
说话人2 08:24
That will come here if they want to short, then they basically these talks reselling the market and the clients have short exposure to this.
说话人3 08:35
I they have the long position and no.
说话人2 08:39
the consumers don't have position. They want to short.

Let's say client a is long thousand stocks, and then this client b wants to short.

So these thousand stocks sit in the inventory. So if this client wants to short, we will sell this. Let's say they want to short 200 stocks. We will short the 200 stock. Right? So they get the short exposure, but the client 1 had thousand stocks, right? Yeah. They can sell any time they want. It's their stock. So if it has been consumed, then there is that thing called recall. Because right now, what let's say, client be wanted to short 200. We took from here, we sold 200, right?

When this client comes, there is only 800 physical stocks remaining, right? If they want to sell all thousand, let's say we will sell this in the market and the rest 200. Basically we will recall it's called recalled this plan, basically, they're short, will disappear. And the plan will take the right. There are some clients that this recall, right? The recall means that's a client sells today, right? Short today. Then in 2 days, let's say this guy says I want to sell my stocks. These 200, the client was - 200, right? In 2 days, they will have zero because we recall them. All right.

But there are some clients that we don't recall. We have like contractual or whatever agreement with them that we are not gonna recall them. So what happens here that one desk will pick up this record? Instead of this client, this client line was - 200, then we said, give us back this 200, they end up having zero. If it's a protected client, we call it protected that we don't recall. This 200, it will not go to the client. This goes to delta one desk. This client will be still - 200, but delta one will be 2 plus 200. This is another source of risk that we are hedging. So that's the better one side of things.

So the initially, hedging means basically you want, let's say you have this portfolio that you want to hedge, right? Let's say, 4,000 names or whatever, right? I guess.
说话人3 11:25
Sorry.
说话人2 11:26
Right? So basically, then you have some stocks that you can sell some futures, right? What we do is you are trying, let's say this is your portfolio, right? And then this is your hedge, and then hedges like you need to find how much to sell from each stock. Right? Let's say you donate them, w one, w two, wn you need to find this.

What we do, you are trying to minimize the risk between portfolio minus this.

So this is done with the factor models,
说话人3 12:50
barra models,
说话人2 12:51
barra factor models. R factor model actually just gives you the variance of a portfolio. Right? Then you minimize it. Yeah. But you can also do so. Before a couple of months ago, we were only trying to minimize the risk, but you can also do minus lambda times expected return of portfolio. This is where alpha comes in. If you put lambda to zero, then you just minimize the risk.

If you increase your lambda, then it will try to maximize the expected return as well. Lambda will play some sort of trade off here. Okay? Yeah. For this, basically, you need some sort of stock signals.
说话人3 13:39
Okay?
说话人2 13:42
There's the delta one part, then the now in that cim as I said, you have the producers producers are the loan holders, so we call them producer, clients, logs. Right? And then you have consumers,
说话人3 14:03
the short set.
说话人2 14:05
So one client can be both producer and consumer, okay, right? When these consumers want to sell the stock, right? Then because our producer clients, they are all market makers like corn funds, so they buy and sell every day. Right? But no consumer client actually likes recourse because let's say they are finally saying the stock is gonna go down, they sell the stock.

And then next day you are saying actually give me the give back the stock, right? Then they cannot materialize their offers, right? They don't want to be recalled.
说话人3 14:43
Yeah.
说话人2 14:44
That's why we do the stability calculation. Let's say one client, we see they have 1 million stock, right? If we can basically more than how much they gonna sell tomorrow, let's say the model says they're gonna sell 200 k tomorrow. Right? Or in the next 5 days, then we will tell this client, we only have 800 k this is the stability. So because we don't show all this 1 million to this guy, because if the producer says tomorrow, then you have to recall the.
说话人3 15:23
so the stability means are previously you required like this amount, but you.
说话人2 15:33
didn't forget about privilege.

Right now, right? Every day at 5:00 pm or 6:00 pm we send the file to clients saying we have these stocks, stock one, we have, let's say, thousand stock two, we have ten k stock free. We have whatever 55 k right?

And then in the morning, next day morning, they will tell us i'm gonna use five k from here, 40 k from here, et cetera. This is the availability that we sent to them, right? But the thing is that we don't show, we don't send them all these stocks that we have in the inventory. Sure. You need to show them the stable part. That's why if we say, for example, this producer, it has 1 million, mhm. Then we do the model and say, on average, they're gonna sell 200 k so we will send here 800 k only.
说话人3 16:27
got it.
说话人2 16:32
So that's the stability model that we have. The thing that it will most likely work on. Right? You are data science background. We calculate the stuff, and then this is just probabilistic model. Right? We are not trying to predict exactly stability. We just say we basically you come up with the probability distribution on how much they gonna sell, okay?

And then you have like expected stability, then you can say the 90 percentiles, percentile, or stability, et cetera. Because if you have distribution function of your wto, that's it, right? You can get any information from that. You want. The reason that I said. We don't predict this because when you call it predict, let's say, for this client, we see 1 million. Then we say 800 k is going to be stable. Then they said, let's say, not 200, but 400 k so in reality, only 600 was stable, right? If you say i'm predicting, then the business will come to you and say, or actually you predicted 800, but they actually sold the way you predicted. They will sell 200, but they actually sold 400, whatever, right? And then like, why is it bad or whatever? But actually, that's why we don't say. We predict, we just say we have the distribution function.

What happens is end of day. Let's say today we calculate all these capabilities.

Let's say stock one is 80 % stable, stock two is 60 % stable. Some stocks are 0 % stable, right? And then when market opens next day, right? There is trading right over this. Client starts trading, selling, or buying, right? But at the same time, we want to know what is the stability during trading hours, we kind of model the stability end of day today, right? Let's say they had 1 million USD in one stock, and then we said it's going to be 80 % stable.

Right now, next day, let's say 11:00 am this client sells hundred k now they have only 900 k right? We want to know intraday was the stable amount out of this.
说话人3 19:15
Stay. We kind.
说话人2 19:19
of modeled stability and on the yesterday.
说话人3 19:23
Yeah.
说话人2 19:25
But now today, like 3 hours past or 2 hours past, we know they sold hundred k what is the new updated stability?

Because you have extra Information here right today, end of the day, you didn't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. Yeah. But now you do know that they sold already hundred k right? Maybe the stability, in this case, actually, just say how pathetically you see that whenever they sell hundred k it means they're gonna sell half of it, whatever the stability, actually, because here we were saying 800 k is going to be stable.

En. But here we already know they sold hundred k or worse. Let's say we said they're gonna sell 200 k but they sold 300 k now you have only 700. So your stability was already, they already are less stable than that. So then you want to know this time.

Now they have 700. How much of this is going to be stable?

We need this logic. Basically. So you will have the previous day stability. You have the clients trading activity up to this time. Yeah. Then you basically try to model the new stability.
说话人3 20:51
How many times should we update this stability?
说话人2 20:57
It's kind of gonna be live.

So every second or whatever.
说话人3 21:02
Okay?
说话人2 21:05
Yeah, I for analysis you can concentrate the only like the market opens 940, right? And closes 11 40:00, yeah. And then opens again at 1:00 pm right? So for starter, you can just concentrate, okay, they sold this much until 11:30 am session. Right? What's the new stability? Once like you have your results at central and we look at the results, and then we say this is a good model. It makes sense, right?

And then you can start looking gather.

other times as well for now don't worry about how many times you just think of. We have the am session how much they sold, and then you try to update the stability factors.
说话人3 21:49
Yeah.
说话人2 21:50
Yeah. So II completely understand this is a the new words for you, right? You never looked at this sort of problems, et cetera. So make sure you fully understand the problem before starting implementing it, ask whatever questions you want. Just make sure that you understand what we are doing fully before jumping and doing the coding.
说话人3 22:13
Okay?
说话人2 22:15
For any project basically just ask me 2,000 questions, ask you in questions, but make sure you understand over the business side why we are doing this, right?

As a quantum. You never want to do something that you don't know why are you doing that. Even if I am asking whoever is asking you, they should tell you why they need that.
说话人1 22:36
Okay?
说话人2 22:38
So understand the project fully and then start modeling.
说话人3 22:45
Okay. Actually, the modeling, the most portion is calculate this stability.
说话人2 22:56
That's the only portion,
说话人3 22:57
not most Porsche. So for me, the first project is firstly understand the context. And is there any specific objective for the first like first project.
说话人2 23:19
objective? You mean?
说话人3 23:21
I the like calculate the stability, like I previously, we have the like some models to do this thing. But for me, I should add some novelty or some new features to do this modeling or other objective,
说话人2 23:50
objective.
说话人3 23:51
to like the target of the per first project.
说话人2 23:57
You mean the performance measure or?

I what we do currently a it's a very, super simple, right? We never tried to model this. What we do currently is we in the morning we predicted a town is going to be stable. We look how much they have.

Now. Let's say they have now 700 k we take the minimum of these two. So there is no modeling super simple logic right now. But then if you come up with your new numbers, we can do back test and see whether this model is better than this simple model. If it's better than that's it. We just start using it.
说话人3 24:37
Okay?
说话人2 24:41
Don't try to over complicate it, like it, introducing new features, et cetera. I would look just you have the previous day stability. You have the today's return, let's say, because this is am session, right? How much the client sold and try to do only on these two to update the stability factor. Let's do the step by step. Let's do like simple model that is still better than this. Then we see if there is a potential, we may be at some more like volume or whatever, like soft level Information and try to see whether we can get.
说话人3 25:20
it better.

But for now,
说话人2 25:22
let's just concentrate. I can only use private stability and how much the clients of today try to give a new stability factor, right? You get used to the infrastructure, how we call that center. You get used to the business side of the finger center. Once we are good and comfortable with this, then we can see whether we want to do better. We want to improve the model or we want.
说话人3 25:46
to do some other project.
说话人2 25:47
Don't overcome complicate for now. Just.
说话人3 25:51
simple think, cool.
说话人2 25:54
You will need to get access to that y drive because all the data is there.
说话人3 25:59
I will raise the request, okay? After that, then I can say some like code to replicate all the logic or other.
说话人2 26:11
no like established functions. Essentially, they are in the fight. They just read files, then you shouldn't have problem pulling. The data is super simple. It's only in the files you will get it straight away.
说话人3 26:21
Okay? So,
说话人2 26:22
yeah, you're not gonna need to do lots of work on cleaning data, but it's very clean and.

you will get the proper data.
说话人1 26:33
Thank you. Otherwise so good.
说话人3 26:35
Yeah, I.
说话人1 26:36
think.
说话人3 26:37
everyone is good and everyone is.
说话人1 26:40
support you. Nice. It's good to know it's one of the questions.
说话人3 26:44
Really, we will have a catch up every week and.
说话人1 26:56
yeah,
说话人3 26:57
report my.
说话人1 26:59
progress to you every week. Yeah, maybe not straight away, but at some point I was set up. So are you met? Eric? I.
说话人3 27:08
don't know.
说话人1 27:10
Yeah. So basically, you don't have any necessary.
说话人3 27:18
Hi, nice to meet you. Ruo, Xue.
说话人1 27:22
Sorry, nice in the cima yes. She will be working on cmt the first project we are trying to get the entire stability based on the present stability. Right? . . 72 is CCTV. We are early hours checking is precise that we have to. You only ask the crucial intraday as we did get located according to our and then all your report. Just for your real stop complaining or Complete to you and on. This is the application, sorry, right? You're welcome, thanks. Why? Then on the must be example, that's not a lot of America. I think that's right. Nasa.
