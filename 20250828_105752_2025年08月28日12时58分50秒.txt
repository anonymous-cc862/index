Nasa,
说话人2 00:55
nasa,
说话人1 01:26
nasa. Byebye. Byebye. Byebye. It was too so far is very. Nasa, ok, byebye. Nasa. Byebye. Ok, byebye. I think three parts, this one and next one is for one, isn't the next one is not funny. So this.
说话人3 03:52
one you have it here, right? Is it the same? Or are they same? And you don't need it?

I won't be for them.
说话人1 04:13
Everything. All.
说话人2 04:17
yes.
说话人1 04:19
Or to say, only say, byebye.
说话人3 04:27
This puff is puffed to itself,
说话人1 04:33
right? Yeah. Nasa.
说话人3 04:38
What's this?
说话人2 04:43
That's the historical data.
说话人3 04:48
All right. You don't need to work in the settings, right? Hard to entry.
说话人2 04:53
products. Right? In my coat.
说话人3 04:57
Yes.
说话人2 05:02
Thank you. I.
说话人3 05:17
only want five.
说话人2 05:20
Thanks for.
说话人1 05:30
Let.
说话人2 05:32
me think for 1 day and 5 day,
说话人3 05:43
you don't need to change the code to do today, right? Because in the 2 day and 5 day, okay?
说话人2 05:55
But, yeah, a little bit different.
说话人3 06:01
Somebody your congress still work, right? So ultimately, whatever we have here, you want to produce a sample here.
说话人2 06:07
That is, we will get the the stability value from the.
说话人3 06:14
stability value that we generate for this, basically, this definition on what numbers you can establish the value.

If you have to exclude some of them, because you choose to do so. For example, let's say, for some reason, you want to exclude this one for some reason, then you can exclude it. We need to keep the settings as minimum as possible. Otherwise, it becomes impossible to manage. You have 10, 20 different.
说话人2 06:42
projects using it, but for the exact value that is the noun in the.
说话人3 06:50
right? But why do you need to have? It decided is that not a new code?
说话人2 07:01
That is use it. I didn't use that that setting. And then this one that is, we convert the the quantity to the us dollars. Why? For 6 days? Because we will get the, if like, that is the show that is usd right?
说话人3 07:31
But you can get the prices for each day, right?
说话人2 07:33
Yeah, price and also get the exchange rate.
说话人3 07:40
That is the price and exchange rate for every day. You don't have to take the price on one day on the.
说话人2 07:48
only the exchange rate.
说话人3 07:50
From addiction rate that one only for exchange rate on the exchange rate, you can also get for every day working.
说话人2 08:00
I just use these days exchange rate to convert it.
说话人3 08:04
exchange rate. You get for all days that you have data. You use one exchange date for one.
说话人1 08:14
this.
说话人3 08:16
calibration start date,
说话人1 08:18
o nnfm. No wonder if you share on ten men. Yes. And our focus on the set more if you did also isis. And then there is an amount of 27, especially in our culture, got the same future.

You have to see. All right. Yes. But video, I suggest a lot of games.
说话人3 09:16
So what was the difference between this and this?
说话人2 09:20
Yeah, this and they are same.
说话人1 09:22
This.
说话人3 09:26
is an input.
说话人2 09:29
ended in the code, in updated code. I didn't use it in code. Code. And it.
说话人1 09:37
double force is extended. Really interested in the country. And it's just in the ways. So one taste, one day smaller.

Txt. Ok. Ok. Nasa vict? Ok. That's already connected, is it?
说话人3 10:25
And they need to this is what? Sorry. In the cash fund hong kong.
说话人1 10:30
Yeah,
说话人3 10:32
for what it is, the cash folder or you cash data.
说话人1 10:38
Txt is soso. Nasa. Nasa. Nasa, nano.
说话人3 11:08
Never test anything in production test. This is your data, right? Yes. You should absolutely never write anything here on this. You have.
说话人1 11:22
very much later covered in china. See you friday.
说话人2 11:26
all in today.
说话人1 11:30
What are they are a.
说话人3 11:38
do you have it open?
说话人1 11:40
Get right. Are you probably what are the reports? I.
说话人3 11:44
know these facts. You have it open.
说话人2 11:46
Yeah, right.
说话人1 11:49
Can you if you are the problem? Nana. Byebye. Nasa.
说话人3 12:08
And you will throw into this. Do you need it?
说话人2 12:11
I don't need it. I'm sorry.
说话人3 12:15
How can you close like an alternative? Yes, thank you. There's your sentence, right? Yes,
说话人1 12:43
nasa. Okay.
说话人3 12:45
I'm just talking else.
说话人1 12:47
Rpk.
说话人3 12:50
not bad. I'm just thinking.
说话人1 12:53
Nasa nasa. Nasa. Byebye. Nasa.
说话人3 13:47
These are the same within this tool,
说话人2 13:56
but the horizon value that's.
说话人3 13:59
okay.
说话人1 14:00
Nasa. We are. Nasa. It's ready for the force. Now. Yes. And. Nasa.
说话人3 15:00
Yeah, I don't know that this is all you need to know.

Rise and body you up here. So you can. Okay, right?
说话人2 15:27
We just need to calculate the 2 days and 5 days out. Stability not one day, because when I construct the the features for 1 day, the constructing method is different from 5 days. Also, how are they different? Good one for this is algorithm, construction or its menu of construction. Where you can see it is a yeah, like for 5 days for it. Like t one time day one, day two, day three, day four, day five. And this is how historical data. For this time, I have a feature named role named 5 days, lack stability in the future.

So for this one, I used not minus this one or this one. I used the previous 5 days, I this stability as one.
说话人3 16:45
feature you can your feature is what the last 5 days of stability, 5 days we're looking forward.
说话人2 16:54
I don't know for this feature, I use this, sorry. I this time step stupidity for this one, because.
说话人1 17:14
Ok, byebye.
说话人2 17:24
Sorry, let me check. So.
说话人1 17:27
that what you have done? Lg. Nasa.
说话人3 17:47
If you are here today,
说话人2 17:49
what's.
说话人3 17:50
the future value today?
说话人2 17:51
Let me check.
说话人1 17:53
Byebye. Nasa. Nasa nasa boss.
说话人2 18:45
use previous.
说话人3 18:49
So for this example, today you have 1 600, 50,000, 500 was the future value.
说话人2 18:54
previous, minimal. Yes, this yesterday, right? Like these 4 days, the minimum number, because we have.
说话人3 19:08
it's stability in this day looking forward. Okay? So you have that for one day.
说话人2 19:14
for day five, I will look back from previous this feature, but why is it different from one? One day? It doesn't have this this feature, because it only based on the 1 days, one day's feature and like rolling, but for 5 years.
说话人3 19:41
But the okay, so then today we have the same features last friday, right? So then you don't need to do much extra work. You just do the same procedure for today.
说话人2 19:53
Okay, right, 5 days. I think it's same with, so.
说话人3 20:02
I ideally, you shouldn't need to make a court change. In this case, it will teach you the.
说话人2 20:06
work. So only use the 5 days framework.
说话人3 20:12
Let's do 1 day, 52 days, 5 day, 2 day and 5 day is used to show some clients. We show 2 day stubborn, some clients we show 5 day stubborn, so this to you donate, okay? For one day, right now there is no direct usage, but ii expect us to have some books, I guess it's going forward.

So this idea, we all the settings that you need, I might have missed something, but there shouldn't be any all your output provides you right into this, right? But again, when you are doing coding, right? When you are testing something, so it just create something.
说话人1 20:57
in your local order. I put up.
说话人3 21:01
after your local folder, then not run your code, make sure it works, whatever, right?

And then once you push into master with holidays and then we change the settings to write in the production.
说话人1 21:13
from them. Go ahead, okok.
说话人2 21:17
no,
说话人1 21:18
nasa. Cctv. Nasa, cctv. Txt drpipcrce yeah. And i'm actually involved with this sentence. Okay?
说话人3 22:03
Just over an approach. Right? The settings is the stuff that not even this, actually,
说话人1 22:20
o nasa.

Ok, byebye, byebye. Byebye.
说话人3 22:53
You can put the exterior paris here. So it's a 1 point. The settings, jason, that we have, it's only kind of if something will change the behavior of the model. Right? For example, let's say this parameter, then it shouldn't be easy to change. Yeah, right. If you leave it here, then anyone can go and make it 16. Then your model is out of control, right? But but this, jason, the reason we are doing all this mesh, right? Because this is is control the environment. You cannot just go and change the code. Someone needs to review attention, right? You need to have the test all this stuff. This jason file is not confronting environment. Anyone can go and change. And if you are changing the 16, actually your model completely changes. It can become complete proud, right? If you put under the extremely out, over feet, right? Then this is something that you have done your research. You're doing your research, right? When you were doing, you found this best parliament.

Now you think my model works well when I have this problem. So you go and put it in a python quote,
说话人2 24:11
right?
说话人3 24:13
And then this becomes controlled environment. If someone wants to make it hungry, they will need to send a review request, and forever is reviewing, will ask why i'm making it. So that's why you need to remove this. Byebye.
说话人1 24:37
Byebye, byebye.
说话人3 24:44
So calibration start date this. We do want to keep into the jason settings, because maybe we actually, for some reason, we don't want to collaborate during all this period, right?

We can change this time horizons. If tomorrow we start trying. Well, later to, I don't know to some plan that we need to show 3 days something, and I can come here and just make it screen. Yeah, right. And by the way, your phone is supposed to be possible for me, I don't need to do that. That's good. If I could create, then it's supposed to output free platform 3 days as well. It's not then.
说话人2 25:22
It's something I will change that.
说话人3 25:27
You have this year why you kind of have everything. Unless you have a strong reason to say, actually, I don't wanna run way more than on the screen, let's say. Then we can create a new mystery, but if you're not doing that, you can just copying them. That's it.

Okay, right? Because if you started doing this much, it's like it becomes very difficult to control. I see we need to keep these settings absolute meaning possible. Right? You cannot always making some smaller. If you can try and understand this,
说话人1 26:12
nasa. Nasa.
说话人3 26:22
Once it's runnable, then let me know, because I pulled your code, I would like to go line by line ok.
说话人1 26:28
we checked, we got a text, I know. Nasa. It seems like a type of a lot of for sure, also. And this.
说话人3 26:52
thing, they need to be alphabetical. So from 7 years later, so you still outside library so make it up with some place and then care about service after that.

So it would be data.
说话人1 27:09
Report, then it is purely for spending. But what was that it's always telecoms zero? I don't know the house, wasn't it? Nasa. Ok, byebye.
说话人2 27:50
Byebye.
